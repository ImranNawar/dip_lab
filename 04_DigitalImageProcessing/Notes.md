## Digital Image Processing
Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform operations on digital images. These operations can include things like image enhancement, restoration, and analysis.

- Digital Image Processing means processing digital image by means of a digital computer.

- Image Processing is a subset of Computer Vision.

## Digital Image Basics:
`Pixels`: The smallest unit of an image.\
`Resolution`: The number of pixels in an image.\
`Color Models`: RGB, grayscale, CMYK, etc.

## Fundamental steps in Digital Image Processing:

## Image Acquisition:

`Image Sensors:` CCD and CMOS. \
Sampling and Quantization.

## Image Enhancement
`Histogram Processing:`

- Histogram equalization.
- Contrast stretching.

`Spatial Domain Methods:`

- `Point operations:` Image negation, intensity transformation.
- `Neighborhood operations:` Image smoothing, sharpening.

`Frequency Domain Methods:`

- Fourier Transform.
- Filtering in frequency domain.

## Image Restoration
`Noise in Images:`

- `Types of noise:` Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, etc.
- Noise reduction techniques: Spatial and frequency domain filtering.

`Image Deblurring:`

- Convolution and deconvolution.
- Wiener filtering.

## Image Compression
`Lossless Compression:`

- Run-Length Encoding (RLE).
- Huffman Coding.

`Lossy Compression:`

- Transform coding: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
- JPEG compression.

## Image Segmentation
`Thresholding:`

- Global and local thresholding.
- Otsu's method.

`Edge Detection:`

- Gradient-based methods: Sobel, Prewitt.
- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG).

Image segmentation is the most difficult part of digital image processing. The more accurate the segmentation, the more likely the recognition is to be succeed

## Object Recognition
`Pattern Recognition:`

- Template matching.
- Feature extraction.

`Classification:`

Decision boundaries.
Machine learning in image processing.

## Morphological Image Processing
`Binary Image Operations:`

- Dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.

`Grayscale Image Operations:`

- Top-hat and bottom-hat transformations.

## Color Image Processing
`Color Models and Transformations:`

- RGB to HSV.
- Color correction.

`Color Image Enhancement and Segmentation.`

## Image Analysis and Computer Vision
`Feature Extraction:`

- Blob analysis.
- Corner detection.

`Object Tracking and Motion Analysis.`
